Welcome to the FMN development environment!

NOTE: Before you can run the services, you need to put valid FAS
credentials in ~/.fedmsg.d/fas_credentials.py; failure to do so
will cause some services to fail to start.

Here are some tips:

* ~/.fedmsg.d/ contains the application configuration; turn on
  various backends in ~/.fedmsg.d/fmn.py

* The code is located at ~/devel/

* You can type `workon fmn` to enter a configured Python virtualenv

* Run `fstart` to start all the necessary services as systemd
  user services. All output is logged by journald! You can see
  all output with `journalctl` or a particular unit's log with
  `journalctl --user-unit <unit-name>`

* Run `fstop` to halt all the services

* The RabbitMQ management console is enabled and available at
  http://localhost:15672/ - the username is "guest" and the password
  is "guest"

* By default, only the SSE backend is enabled. To enable other backends,
  turn them on in ~/.fedmsg/fmn.py

Once you run `fstart` you can navigate to http://localhost:5000/
in your browser to view the FMN web interface.

Happy hacking!
