FedMSG Notifications
====================

``fmn`` is a family of systems to manage end-user notifications triggered by
`fedmsg, the FEDerated MESsage bus <http://fedmsg.com>`_. ``fmn`` provides a
single place for all applications using ``fedmsg`` to notify users of events.
Notifications can be delivered by email, irc, and server-sent events. Users
can configure their notifications for all the applications they use in one
place.

FMN is deployed in `Fedora <https://apps.fedoraproject.org/notifications/>`_.
